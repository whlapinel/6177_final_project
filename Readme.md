## 4/13/24:
- Successfully took a GET request from a client containing text, obtained audio from TTS service and then returned an audio file to the client!

- Postman doesn't seem to be able to play files directly but the browser will play them. Next I'll need to allow the user to choose a voice from the list of voices as well as entering text.

- :8080/docs will now allow user to request voices list. next up, include ability to select voice and then enter text from docs page.
